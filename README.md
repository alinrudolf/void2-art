# VOID Overview (Gatsby)

Rebuilt VOID presentation site in Gatsby (desktop-first).

## Getting started

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run develop
```

The site runs at http://localhost:8000 by default. Use `npm run build` to produce the static build and `npm run serve` to preview it.

## Notes

- Fonts are loaded locally from `static/fonts` (Advercase Demo, IBM Plex Mono) plus Inter Black via `@fontsource/inter`.
- The hero illustration lives in `static/img/void-main-sketch-v2.png`.
- Content is static for now; the CTA has no submission handler.
